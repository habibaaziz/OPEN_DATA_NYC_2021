# Open Data Week NYC 2021: Machine learning with Python
New York, like many other cities across the United States, [publishes open data sets](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) that are easily accessible via a web portal as well as an API.
[Open Data Week](https://www.open-data.nyc/) is an event held in early March to promote data literacy as well as the rich data sets generously made available by the city.

## Introduction to machine learning
Our project introduces practical machine learning via Python with the [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) library. Python is a minimalist, interpreted programming language that is well suited for data analysis.
Scikit-learn implements many statistical learning algorithms with a consistent API. Our goal is to demystify ML via a simple introduction that won't get into the math but still discuss the algorithms beyond just fit() and predict().

We are using the [https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Clean-Heat-Dataset-Historical-/8isn-pgv3](Clean Heat) data set from New York's Open Data portal.
